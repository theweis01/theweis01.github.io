<h3>Dear Superintendent and School Board Members</h3>

<p>I am writing as a resident of the Loveland City School District to urge you, our
Superintendent and elected School Board members, to maintain the all staff and
PreK through 6th grade universal indoor masking requirements, scheduled to
end January 18, 2021. I am also writing to request that the current universal
indoor masking requirement be expanded to include students in grades 7 -12.
This request is being made in consideration of the recent COVID-19 Omicron
variant case surge, which has been shown to be more transmissible and
contagious than previous variants.</p><p>
The Ohio Department of Health, the Ohio Department of Education, the
American Academy of Pediatrics, the CDC, and locally, the Cincinnati Children’s
Hospital Medical Center, recently provided clear guidance for universal masking
in schools and in the community. Universal indoor masking, in addition to
vaccination and access boosters for those eligible, are strongly recommended as
the best tools, especially when used in tandem, for mitigating the spread of
COVID-19 and the current variant.</p><p>
The pandemic also continues to take a toll on our children’s and educators’
mental health. Since the pandemic began, rates of psychological distress among
young people, including anxiety, depression, and other mental health disorders
have increased substantially. There is much to be done and each of us has a
part to play. Supporting the mental health of youth will require a community effort
to address challenges, strengthen the resilience of young people, support their
families, and mitigate the pandemic’s mental health impact.</p>

<p>As a resident of the Loveland City School District, I am asking that you consider
the following actions:
<ol>
<li>Maintain universal indoor masking for all staff.</li>
<li>Maintain Universal indoor masking for all students Pre-K through Grade 6.</li>
<li>universal indoor masking requirements to include students in
grades 7 - 12.</li>
<li>Identify a threshold for educator and/or student absence at which the
district will move forward with a remote learning plan.</li>
<li>Increase the frequency with which you report to the public student and
educator absences as well as individuals positive for COVID.</li>
<li>Create and promote safe, positive, and affirming school environments
which are inclusive and supportive of student’s social, emotional, and
cultural needs.</li>
<li>key administrative, educator, and paraprofessional staff with the
necessary training to recognize signs of changes in mental and physical
health among students.</li>
<li>Mental health gatekeeper training so that staff and peers take
appropriate action when needed.</li>
<li>The mental health of all school personnel, including providing
competitive wages, time off, access to well paid substitute teachers,
regularly assessing staff well-being, and integrating measures to help
personnel maintain their own empathy, compassion, and ability to create
positive environments for students.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
As superintendent and elected school board members, your roles include
the evaluation of district operations, interpretations of public health
policies, and health service delivery. My role as a district resident is to help
our district leadership identify the areas in need of protection, prioritization,
and planning to keep Loveland City School District safe and in school:
Universal Indoor Mask Requirements and Adequate Mental Health Support for Students and Staff<br>
Signed,
